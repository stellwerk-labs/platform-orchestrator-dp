# Worklog

## Server artifact foundation

- Added pinned image bases, deterministic Go build settings, architecture-specific /licenses collection, exact SDK source-license provenance, and safe OCI payload inspection/scanning.
- Added helper fixture tests with mandatory pinned go-licenses and gitleaks, including both architectures, changed/missing legal content, binary secrets and whiteouts.
- Fixture/static evidence only. Production builds, hosted suites, public SDK resolution, independent full-image reproducibility and cryptographic attestation verification remain separate required evidence.
- See DECISIONS.md and LEARNINGS.md for the scope and tool limitations.
